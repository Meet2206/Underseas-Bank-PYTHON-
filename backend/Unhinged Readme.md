# 🏦 Bank.py — A Completely Responsible Banking System

Welcome to **Bank.py**, a backend banking API built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

It allows users to create accounts, authenticate themselves, and transfer money between accounts like a responsible adult… except the money is fake and the responsibility is questionable.

---

# 🧠 Why This Exists

I wanted to learn how real banking systems work.

So naturally I built one that:

* authenticates users
* creates accounts
* moves money
* records transactions

All without regulators, auditors, or a board of directors asking uncomfortable questions.

# 🚀 Running The Project

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank.py
cd bank.py
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open:

```

Where Swagger UI lets you simulate financial power you absolutely do not have in real life.

# 🧪 Example API Flow

### Register

```json
POST /auth/register
{
 "name": "Test User",
 "email": "test@test.com",
 "phone_number": "9000000001",
 "mpin": "1234"
}
```

---

### Login

```json
POST /auth/login
{
 "phone_number": "9000000001",
 "mpin": "1234"
}
```

Returns a JWT token proving that you are now a **trusted financial entity**.

---

### Create Account

```json
POST /accounts/create
{
 "account_type": "savings"
}
```

You now possess a powerful database row.

---

### Transfer Money

```json
POST /transactions/transfer
{
 "receiver_account": "1234567890",
 "amount": 200
}
```

Congratulations. You have moved numbers between tables.

# 🔒 Security

This system includes:

* MPIN hashing
* JWT authentication
* Request validation
* Protected routes

Which means it is **significantly more secure than most college projects**.

---

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is **not a real bank**.

If you try to:

* deposit real money
* pay bills
* buy a yacht

The database will simply stare at you in confusion.

Backend developer who built a banking system
without having access to actual money.
